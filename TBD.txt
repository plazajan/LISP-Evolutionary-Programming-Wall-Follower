===============================================================================

To do (Developer's Notes):

1. In *world*, mark places next to the wall by natural numbers.
   Have an array indexed by these numbers, initialized to 0's.
   Improve evaluate-c, so that whenever it visits a cell next to the wall
   it writes a 1 to the array. After a complete tour, sum these 1's.

2. Generate agents in cnf, simplified and not simplified.

3. Replace *came-from* by *direction* (the opposite).

4. *population-size* = 1 does not work. Correct this bug.
